### the core Media Application Function library

Located in *subprojects/maf*, this is the core library for the MAF API exposed by media pipelines.

It includes a simple factory to register and retrieve media pipelines as plugins.

If your contribution makes changes to the public API (factory, plugins, MAF api), make sure to re-generate the SWIG wrappers.
