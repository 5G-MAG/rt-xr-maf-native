### C# bindings

The  *subprojects/maf_csharp* subproject provides C# bindings for the MAF library.

**The bindings are generated by [SWIG](https://swig.org/) :**
```
subprojects/maf_csharp/maf.cpp
subprojects/maf_csharp/maf
```

the `maf.i` file should be edited and the bindings re-generated using SWIG:

Make sure to remove previously generated bindings before generating new ones to keep the directory clean:
```
swig -c++ -csharp -namespace maf -dllimport maf_cs -Isubprojects/maf/include -o subprojects/maf_csharp/maf.cpp -outdir subprojects/maf_csharp/maf subprojects/maf_csharp/maf.i
```
